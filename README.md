AmpleNote plugin to populate routine daily tasks from a template so you can reorder them accordingly without altering their start time

Given a note template, this plug-in will populate the current note with tasks and their start time.

E.g.
// Note template:
//
// 6 am - wake up, meditate
// 7 am - workout
// 6 pm - dinner

This is a workaround for recurring daily tasks that allows you to move them around. Currently, you cannot lock the start times for recurring tasks. If you move them, that new start time will carry over to the next day.
